For my corpus I would like to compare my Spotify Wrapped playlist to my friends and familys Wrapped playlitst. The reason I chose this is because I think that a lot of people like the Wrapped playlists and its a fun way to see what you listened to the previous year. I also think it's interesting to see if the playlists are accurate and if the persons actually listened to the songs in it. I think it's fun to just see what I listened to and what my friends listend to, and what the difference is. I have 2 Wrapped playlists to compare to mine. I know mine has a lot of pop music in it, so I expect it will have a lot of songs in it with a fast tempo and a high valence. One of my friends, Hemke, listened to a few artists that i also listened to, so i expect ours will have some similair features. My other friend, Fleur, listens to more rap music, so i expect hers to have al lot of energy and maybe danceability. Fleur has a lot of songs in her playlist that I dont know, so i think it will be interessting to see how it compares to mine and Hemke's playlists. I expect it will be quite different to ours. We all listen to music only in Spotify, so I think the information that i get from the playlists will be accurate.
