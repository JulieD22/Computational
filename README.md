PLEASE DO NOT SHOW THIS PORTFOLIO IN CLASS
For my corpus I would like to compare my Spotify Wrapped playlist to my friends and familys Wrapped playlitst. The reason I chose this is because I think that a lot of people like the Wrapped playlists and its a fun way to see what you listened to the previous year. I also think it's interesting to see if the playlists are accurate and if the persons actually listened to the song, or that maybe it was something for school or something like sleeping sounds. And you can see if you listened to the same music and what kind of music. Did people listen to a lot of top 40? Or maybe rap, or music from the 80's?  I am going to compare my playlist, my brothers and two of my friends.  I know that my brother has a very specific tastes so I think he will have some interessting tracks. My own playlist has a lot of pop but also instrtumental music (like film music) and I expect that my playlist will have the most in common with my friends. And my brothes playlist probably won't have a lot of the same songs. I know that we all listen to music on Spotify and no other music platform or cds. I do have songs in my playlist that I had to listen to for muziekgeschiedenis and I know that (before corona) one of my friends used her Spotify for music in the cafe that she worked in. I expect that our playlists will have some songs in it that we don't actually listen to.
